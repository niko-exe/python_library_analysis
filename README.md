# Python Data Analysis

## Overview

The whole point of this project was to get my hands dirty with Python for data analysis. Using code to generate visuals, understanding the data, and having more granular control were some of the key takeaways of this project. 


Being able to use a code language to clean, organize, structure, and present data was something I never knew that I could have done, and that being said, I think this has broadened my horizon on how to effectively use Python for data analysis.
